                        learned everything from variables and datatypes to defining our own
                        complex functions.

                        of just about every programer before me. Typing a single line of
                        code and pressing 'Enter'. This was done in Windows Command Prompt
                        useing Python.

                        <p>As you can probably tell my name is Dylan Katina. As of posting this I'm 23.
                            I graduated college with a B.S. in Pre-Med Biology in 2021. I've had an interesting
                            time figuring out what I want out of life, and discovering what it is that makes me happy.
                            After a few good conversations with myself and others I've discovered that what I want 
                            out of life is to create. To build, rethink, rebuild until my vision is no longer just a vision.
                            So here I am, building my vision.

                        <ul class="ilist">
                            <li><b>Games</b>: I'm a huge gaming nerd. Grew up on the original X-box and
                            and stuck to console until I built my first gaming PC when I was 14.</li>
                            <li><b>Travel</b>: I feel like everyone loves to travel, and I am no different.
                            I've been all over the western hemisphere: Mexico, Costa Rica, Honduras, Carribean Islands,
                            Pacific Islands and have loved it all. Sooner or later I'll need to cross the pond
                            and visit Europe. I'd really love to see Norway, England, Greece, and Italy to name a few.
                        </li>
                            <li><b>Dogs</b>: I love most animals, but there is nothing like an animal that 
                                loves you back. Yeah my fiancée is nice, but my dog Rhia is my number one fan,
                                and all I have to do is keep feeding her
